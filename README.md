# fn_compose

Typed functional composition in Dart.

### Examples
```dart
C(initial value).x(first function).x(second function).execute();
C(5).x(addOne).execute();
```

### Todo / might do later
* output a function
* define just a function
* Cannot implement the >> operator because operator generics are not possible in Dart at the moment

This is just a playful thing, nothing serious!
